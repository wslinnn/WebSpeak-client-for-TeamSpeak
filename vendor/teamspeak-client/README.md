## Features

- **Full protocol handshake** — ECDH key exchange, RSA puzzle, EAX-encrypted transport
- **Command & notification system** — Send commands, receive server events
- **Event-driven API** — Register handlers for text messages, client enter/leave, channel moves, kicks, etc.
- **Live directory snapshots** — Receive the channel tree and all visible clients from the same session, including channel movement updates
- **Voice data** — Send Opus voice packets (codec 4 & 5)
- **Whisper voice packets** — Send Opus voice to selected client IDs without a second maintenance connection
- **File transfers** — Upload, download, and delete files on the server
- **Address resolution** — SRV records, TSDNS, and direct address support
- **Middleware** — Pluggable command and event middleware chains
- **Built-in rate limiter** — Token-bucket throttling to prevent server-side flood kicks
- **Identity management** — Generate, import/export, and upgrade security level of identities
- **Dual format** — Ships ESM and CJS with full TypeScript declarations
- **Zero native deps** — Pure TypeScript, no native addons required

## Installation

```bash
npm install @echosixhiya/teamspeak-client
# or
pnpm add @echosixhiya/teamspeak-client
```

Requires **Node.js 20.19** or later.

## Quick Start

```typescript
import { Client, generateIdentity } from "@echosixhiya/teamspeak-client";

// Generate a new identity (or load an existing one)
const identity = generateIdentity(8);

// Create the client
const client = new Client(identity, "localhost", "TSBot", {
  serverPassword: process.env.TEAMSPEAK_SERVER_PASSWORD,
  defaultChannel: "Lobby",
  defaultChannelPassword: process.env.TEAMSPEAK_DEFAULT_CHANNEL_PASSWORD,
});

// Register event handlers
client.on("connected", () => {
  console.log("Connected to server!");
});

client.on("textMessage", (msg) => {
  console.log(`[${msg.invokerName}]: ${msg.message}`);
});

client.on("directorySnapshot", ({ channels, clients }) => {
  console.log(`Directory: ${channels.length} channels, ${clients.length} clients`);
});

client.on("disconnected", (err) => {
  console.log("Disconnected:", err?.message ?? "clean");
});

// Connect
await client.connect();

// Wait until connected (with 15s timeout)
await client.waitConnected(AbortSignal.timeout(15_000));

// Stay connected until interrupted
process.on("SIGINT", async () => {
  await client.disconnect();
});
```

// Export to string for persistent storage
const exported = identity.exportString();

// Import from a previously exported string
const restored = identityFromString(exported);

// Upgrade security level (CPU-intensive)
identity.upgradeToLevel(10);
```

### Options

```typescript
const client = new Client(identity, "ts.example.com", "Bot", {
  logger: consoleLogger,
  resolver: customResolver,
  commandMiddleware: [loggingMiddleware],
  eventMiddleware: [filterMiddleware],
  serverPassword: process.env.TEAMSPEAK_SERVER_PASSWORD,
  defaultChannel: "Lobby",
  defaultChannelPassword: process.env.TEAMSPEAK_DEFAULT_CHANNEL_PASSWORD,
});
```

Connection auth options:

- `serverPassword`: plain-text server password; sent as the TeamSpeak protocol hash during `clientinit`
- `defaultChannel`: default channel name requested during `clientinit`
- `defaultChannelPassword`: plain-text password for `defaultChannel`; sent as the TeamSpeak protocol hash

## Subpath Exports

The package provides granular subpath exports for advanced use cases:

```typescript
import { Identity } from "@echosixhiya/teamspeak-client/crypto";
import { Resolver } from "@echosixhiya/teamspeak-client/discovery";
import { PacketHandler } from "@echosixhiya/teamspeak-client/transport";
import { buildCommand, parseCommand } from "@echosixhiya/teamspeak-client/command";
import { processInit1 } from "@echosixhiya/teamspeak-client/handshake";
```
